# Literacy Analysis & Improvement Planning in Pakistan System
This project uses machine learning and deep learning to predict education performance (measured as `EducationScore`) across districts in Pakistan. It leverages infrastructure, enrollment, budget, and demographic data to support policy decisions for improving literacy.

## Problem Statement

Pakistan faces significant challenges in providing equitable education across provinces and districts. Unequal resource distribution, low infrastructure quality, and teacher shortages all contribute to poor literacy outcomes. There is a need for a predictive system to simulate the effects of investment and policy changes.

## Objective

- Predict `EducationScore` using features like school infrastructure, gender parity, and enrollment.
- Simulate the impact of increased budget, population, or facilities on district performance.
- Compute and analyze `UtilityScore` to guide optimal resource allocation.
- Enable real-time prediction using user input (city, budget, teachers, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
